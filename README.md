## PROBLEM STATEMENT 
We are given the dataset consisting of details of Facebook pages and their posts. The goal is to predict how many 
comments a user generated posts is expected to receive in the given set of hours on Facebook. We need to model the 
user comments pattern over a set of variables which are provided and get to the right number of comments for each post 
with minimum error possible.

## NEED OF THE STUDY 
Brands are constantly trying to drive engagements with the customers and trying to get their feedback and response. 
For this, social media is a widespread tool which is being used by almost every major brand. But to measure the 
customersâ€™ response and feedback on social media and generate content on the basis of those feedback is a challenge 
for the brands. For this, brands need to be able to understand what kind of a post drives higher or lower engagement on 
Facebook.

## BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY 
For both small businesses and large corporations, social media is playing a key role in brand building and customer 
communication. Facebook is the social networking site relevant for firms to make themselves real for customers. Just to 
put things in context, the advertising revenue of Facebook in the United States in 2018 stands up to 14.89 billion US dollars. 
The advertising revenue outside the United States comes down to 18.95 billion US dollars. Latest research reports have 
indicated that user generated content on Facebook drives higher engagement than ads. The amount of data that gets 
added to the network increases day by day and it is a gold mine of researchers who want to understand the intricacies of 
user behavior and user engagement. In this Project, we discuss one such problem where we take a step towards 
understanding the highly dynamic behavior of users towards Facebook posts.
